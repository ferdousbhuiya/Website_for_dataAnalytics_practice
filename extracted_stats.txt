## **Part 3: Answers & Explanations**
### **Answers to Question Set 1:**
1. **Data**: 4, 8, 6, 5, 3, 8, 9 (sorted: 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 8, 9)
   - Mean = (4+8+6+5+3+8+9)/7 = 43/7 = **6.14**
   - Median (middle value) = **6**
   - Mode (most frequent) = **8**
2. **Data**: 10, 12, 14, 16, 18
   - Range = 18 - 10 = **8**
   - Mean = (10+12+14+16+18)/5 = 70/5 = 14
   - Standard deviation:
     Steps: (10-14)²=16, (12-14)²=4, (14-14)²=0, (16-14)²=4, (18-14)²=16
     Sum = 40
     s² = 40/(5-1) = 10
     s = √10 ≈ **3.16**
3. **Missing number**:
   Let x be the fifth number
   (15+25+20+18+x)/5 = 20
   78 + x = 100
   x = **22**
### **Answers to Question Set 2:**
4. **Die probabilities**:
   a) P(even) = 3/6 = **1/2** or **0.5** (even numbers: 2, 4, 6)
   b) P(>4) = 2/6 = **1/3** or **0.333** (numbers: 5, 6)
5. **Student probability**:
   Using: P(A∪B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A∩B)
   P(Math) = 18/30 = 0.6
   P(Physics) = 15/30 = 0.5
   P(Both) = 6/30 = 0.2
   P(Math or Physics) = 0.6 + 0.5 - 0.2 = **0.9** or **27/30**
### **Answers to Question Set 3:**
6. **Dataset analysis**: [2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9]
   a) **Mode (4)** or **median (4.5)** best represents this data
   b) The mean (5) might be misleading because it's affected by the extreme value (9)
7. **Variance to standard deviation**:
   Standard deviation = √variance = √25 = **5**

## **Part 1: Detailed Lesson**
### **1. Descriptive Statistics**
#### **Measures of Central Tendency:**
- **Mean (Arithmetic)**: 
  ```
  Population: μ = ΣX / N
  Sample: x̄ = Σx / n
  ```
- **Weighted Mean**: 
  ```
  x̄_w = Σ(wᵢ * xᵢ) / Σwᵢ
  ```
- **Geometric Mean**: Used for growth rates
  ```
  GM = (∏xᵢ)^(1/n) or antilog(Σlog x / n)
  ```
**Example**: Calculate geometric mean of growth rates: 1.05, 1.08, 1.12
```
GM = (1.05 × 1.08 × 1.12)^(1/3) = 1.0832
Average growth = 8.32%
```
#### **Measures of Dispersion:**
1. **Variance**:
   ```
   Population: σ² = Σ(x - μ)² / N
   Sample: s² = Σ(x - x̄)² / (n-1)  (Bessel's correction)
   ```
2. **Standard Deviation**: 
   ```
   σ = √σ² or s = √s²
   ```
3. **Coefficient of Variation**: 
   ```
   CV = (σ/μ) × 100%  (for comparing variability across datasets)
   ```
4. **Interquartile Range (IQR)**:
   ```
   IQR = Q₃ - Q₁
   Q₁ = 25th percentile, Q₃ = 75th percentile
   ```
### **2. Probability Theory**
#### **Basic Rules:**
1. **Addition Rule**: P(A∪B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A∩B)
2. **Multiplication Rule**: P(A∩B) = P(A) × P(B|A)
3. **Complement Rule**: P(A') = 1 - P(A)
#### **Conditional Probability**:
```
P(A|B) = P(A∩B) / P(B), provided P(B) > 0
```
#### **Bayes' Theorem**:
```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) × P(A)] / P(B)
```
### **3. Probability Distributions**
#### **Binomial Distribution**:
- **Conditions**: Fixed trials, independent, two outcomes
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  P(X=k) = C(n,k) × p^k × (1-p)^(n-k)
  ```
  where C(n,k) = n!/(k!(n-k)!)
- **Mean**: μ = np
- **Variance**: σ² = np(1-p)
#### **Normal Distribution**:
- **Properties**: Bell-shaped, symmetric, mean=median=mode
- **Empirical Rule**:
  - 68% within μ ± 1σ
  - 95% within μ ± 2σ
  - 99.7% within μ ± 3σ
- **Z-score**: 
  ```
  z = (x - μ)/σ
  ```
### **4. Inferential Statistics**
#### **Central Limit Theorem**:
For large n (typically n≥30), sampling distribution of means is approximately normal with:
```
Mean: μ_x̄ = μ
Standard Error: σ_x̄ = σ/√n
```
#### **Confidence Intervals**:
- **For mean (σ known)**:
  ```
  CI = x̄ ± z*(σ/√n)
  ```
- **For mean (σ unknown)**:
  ```
  CI = x̄ ± t*(s/√n)
  ```
  (uses t-distribution with n-1 df)
#### **Hypothesis Testing Steps**:
1. State H₀ and H₁
2. Choose α (typically 0.05)
3. Calculate test statistic
4. Find p-value
5. Make decision

## **Part 2: Advanced Questions with Detailed Solutions**
### **Question Set 1: Probability & Distributions**
**Q1**: A factory produces items with 2% defect rate. In a sample of 50 items:
a) What's the probability of exactly 2 defectives?
b) What's the probability of at least 2 defectives?
**Solution**:
```
n=50, p=0.02, q=0.98
a) P(X=2) = C(50,2) × (0.02)² × (0.98)⁴⁸
   C(50,2) = 50!/(2!48!) = 1225
   P(X=2) = 1225 × 0.0004 × 0.3812 ≈ 0.1858
b) P(X≥2) = 1 - P(X=0) - P(X=1)
   P(X=0) = (0.98)⁵⁰ = 0.3642
   P(X=1) = 50 × 0.02 × (0.98)⁴⁹ = 50 × 0.02 × 0.3716 = 0.3716
   P(X≥2) = 1 - 0.3642 - 0.3716 = 0.2642
```

**Q2**: Test scores are normally distributed with μ=75, σ=8.
a) What percentage scored above 85?
b) Between what scores do the middle 90% lie?
**Solution**:
```
a) z = (85-75)/8 = 1.25
   P(Z>1.25) = 1 - 0.8944 = 0.1056 = 10.56%
b) Middle 90% means 5% in each tail
   z for 95th percentile = 1.645
   Lower bound: 75 - 1.645×8 = 61.84
   Upper bound: 75 + 1.645×8 = 88.16
   Middle 90%: 61.84 to 88.16
```

### **Question Set 2: Inferential Statistics**
**Q3**: A sample of 36 students has mean score x̄=82, s=12.
a) Construct 95% CI for population mean
b) Construct 99% CI
c) How does CI width change with confidence level?
**Solution**:
```
n=36, x̄=82, s=12
a) 95% CI (t₀.₀₂₅,₃₅ ≈ 2.030)
   CI = 82 ± 2.030×(12/√36)
       = 82 ± 2.030×2
       = 82 ± 4.06
       = [77.94, 86.06]
b) 99% CI (t₀.₀₀₅,₃₅ ≈ 2.724)
   CI = 82 ± 2.724×2
       = 82 ± 5.45
       = [76.55, 87.45]
c) As confidence level increases, CI width increases

**Q4**: A company claims average battery life ≥100 hours. Sample of 40 batteries: x̄=98, s=8.
Test at α=0.05 if claim is valid.
**Solution**:
```
Step 1: H₀: μ ≥ 100, H₁: μ < 100 (one-tailed)
Step 2: α=0.05, df=39
Step 3: t = (x̄ - μ)/(s/√n)
        = (98-100)/(8/√40)
        = -2/(8/6.3246)
        = -2/1.2649 = -1.581
Step 4: Critical value t₀.₀₅,₃₉ ≈ -1.685
        p-value ≈ 0.061
Step 5: Since t=-1.581 > -1.685, fail to reject H₀
        (or p-value=0.061 > 0.05)
Conclusion: Insufficient evidence to reject company's claim
```

### **Question Set 3: Advanced Applications**
**Q5**: Two machines produce components. Machine A: n₁=50, x̄₁=12.3mm, s₁=0.5mm
Machine B: n₂=60, x̄₂=12.1mm, s₂=0.6mm
Test if means differ at α=0.01.
**Solution**:
```
H₀: μ₁ = μ₂, H₁: μ₁ ≠ μ₂
Pooled variance (assuming equal variances):
s_p² = [(n₁-1)s₁² + (n₂-1)s₂²]/(n₁+n₂-2)
     = [49×0.25 + 59×0.36]/108
     = [12.25 + 21.24]/108
     = 33.49/108 = 0.3101
s_p = 0.5569
Test statistic:
t = (x̄₁ - x̄₂)/[s_p × √(1/n₁ + 1/n₂)]
  = (12.3-12.1)/[0.5569 × √(1/50 + 1/60)]
  = 0.2/[0.5569 × √(0.02 + 0.01667)]
  = 0.2/[0.5569 × √0.03667]
  = 0.2/[0.5569 × 0.1915]
  = 0.2/0.1066 = 1.876
Critical value t₀.₀₀₅,₁₀₈ ≈ ±2.624
Since |1.876| < 2.624, fail to reject H₀
No significant difference in means

**Q6**: Calculate correlation coefficient for:
X: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
Y: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
**Solution**:
```
n=5
Σx=30, Σy=25, Σx²=220, Σy²=165, Σxy=150
r = [nΣxy - ΣxΣy]/√{[nΣx²-(Σx)²][nΣy²-(Σy)²]}
  = [5×150 - 30×25]/√{[5×220-900][5×165-625]}
  = [750-750]/√{[1100-900][825-625]}
  = 0/√{[200][200]} = 0/√40000 = 0
Wait - visually these are perfectly correlated. Let's recalculate:
Σxy = (2×1)+(4×3)+(6×5)+(8×7)+(10×9)
    = 2+12+30+56+90 = 190
r = [5×190 - 30×25]/√{[1100-900][825-625]}
  = [950-750]/√{[200][200]}
  = 200/√40000 = 200/200 = 1
Perfect positive correlation (r=1)
```

## **Part 3: Complex Problem Set**
**Q7**: Time series analysis with moving averages
Data: 120, 135, 142, 138, 155, 148, 160 (sales in thousands)
a) Calculate 3-period moving average
b) Calculate centered moving average
c) Calculate MSE for moving average forecast
**Solution**:
```
a) 3-period MA:
   Period 4: (135+142+138)/3 = 138.33
   Period 5: (142+138+155)/3 = 145.00
   Period 6: (138+155+148)/3 = 147.00
   Period 7: (155+148+160)/3 = 154.33
b) Centered MA (for even periods):
   Not applicable here as n=7 is odd
c) MSE for periods 4-7:
   Errors: 138-138.33=-0.33, 155-145=10, 148-147=1, 160-154.33=5.67
   Squared errors: 0.1089, 100, 1, 32.1489
   MSE = (0.1089+100+1+32.1489)/4 = 133.2578/4 = 33.31
```

**Q8**: Multiple regression interpretation
Regression output: ŷ = 50 + 2.5x₁ + 1.8x₂ - 0.9x₃
R² = 0.85, Adjusted R² = 0.83, n=100
Interpret coefficients and model fit.
**Solution**:
```
Interpretation:
- Intercept (50): Expected y when all x=0
- x₁ coefficient (2.5): For each unit increase in x₁, y increases by 2.5 units, holding other variables constant
- x₂ coefficient (1.8): For each unit increase in x₂, y increases by 1.8 units
- x₃ coefficient (-0.9): For each unit increase in x₃, y decreases by 0.9 units
Model fit:
- R²=0.85: 85% of variance in y explained by model
- Adj R²=0.83: Adjusted for number of predictors
- Good explanatory power
