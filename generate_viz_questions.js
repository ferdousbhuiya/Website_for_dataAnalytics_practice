    // Questions 2-25 for Visualization (24 more needed)
    { number: 2, difficulty: "medium", question: "A pie chart shows market share with 8 slices, the smallest being 2%. What's wrong with this visualization?", context: "Consider readability and best practices.", answer: `<h4>Issues:</h4><ul><li>Too many slices make it hard to compare</li><li>Small slices (2%) are difficult to see and label</li><li>Pie charts work best with 5-6 categories maximum</li></ul><h4>Better Solution:</h4><p>Use a horizontal bar chart sorted by value, or group smaller categories into "Other".</p>` },
    { number: 3, difficulty: "easy", question: "What chart type should you use to show the relationship between advertising spend and sales revenue?", context: "Looking for correlation.", answer: `<h4>Answer: Scatter Plot</h4><p>Scatter plots show relationships between two continuous variables. Each point represents one observation, making patterns and correlations visible. Add a trend line to show the strength and direction of the relationship.</p>` },
    { number: 4, difficulty: "medium", question: "You need to compare sales across 4 regions for 3 product categories. What visualization works best?", context: "Multiple dimensions to display.", answer: `<h4>Answer: Grouped Bar Chart</h4><p>Group bars by region, with different colors for each product category. This allows easy comparison both within and across regions. Alternative: Small multiples (separate charts for each region).</p>` },
    { number: 5, difficulty: "easy", question: "When should you NOT start a bar chart's y-axis at zero?", context: "Consider when it's acceptable.", answer: `<h4>Answer: Almost Never</h4><p>Bar charts should ALWAYS start at zero because the bar length represents the value. Starting elsewhere distorts perception. Exception: If showing very small changes in large numbers, use a line chart instead.</p>` },

    { number: 12, difficulty: "medium", question: "When would you use a dual-axis chart, and what are the risks?", context: "Advanced charting technique.", answer: `<h4>Use When:</h4><p>Comparing two metrics with different scales (e.g., revenue and conversion rate)</p><h4>Risks:</h4><ul><li>Can be misleading if scales are manipulated</li><li>Difficult to read accurately</li><li>Can exaggerate or hide relationships</li></ul><h4>Alternative:</h4><p>Use two separate charts or normalize the data to same scale.</p>` },

    { number: 15, difficulty: "easy", question: "What's the 5-second rule for dashboards?", context: "Dashboard design principle.", answer: `<h4>The 5-Second Rule:</h4><p>A viewer should be able to understand the main message or identify the key metric within 5 seconds of looking at the dashboard.</p><h4>Achieve This By:</h4><ul><li>Clear visual hierarchy</li><li>Prominent KPIs</li><li>Minimal clutter</li><li>Effective use of color and size</li></ul>` },
    { number: 16, difficulty: "medium", question: "Compare stacked bar charts vs. grouped bar charts.
